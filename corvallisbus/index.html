  <h2><a name="upcoming-cts-schedule">Update For Upcoming CTS Schedule (15th September 2019)</a></h2>
  <p>
    The app has been updated with new transit data. Please let me know via email if you encounter any issues.
  </p>

  <h2>Update For Upcoming CTS Schedule (9th September 2019)</h2>
  <p>
    Corvallis Transit System is expanding service, which changes routes, schedules, and stops in the bus system. Information shown in the app may be inaccurate right now. I am working with CTS to get an up-to-date data set in the app and will update this page once that is complete.
  </p>

  <h3>How the app works</h3>
  <p>
    Corvallis Bus shows live estimates as well as scheduled arrival times. <b>Estimates</b> run up to 30 minutes in the future
    and appear as "minutes from now", as in "<b>23 minutes</b>". <b>Schedules</b> are set for the whole day and appear as
    a timestamp, as in "<b>9:38 AM</b>". The app shows the most relevant set of estimates and scheduled times for a given
    bus stop.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app will show the 2 nearest arrival times for each route at a given stop. This could consist of only estimates, or a
    combination of an estimate and the following scheduled time, or only scheduled times. Corvallis Bus tries to guess which
    of the live estimates from the city's service correspond which scheduled times to avoid showing multiple times for the
    same bus.
  </p>
  <p>
    Corvallis Bus also notices when a scheduled bus is late: if a bus is scheduled to arrive in fewer than 30 minutes, but no
    estimate is being emitted from the city's service, the app shows the time as "over 30 minutes" during a 10 minute grace
    period. When the bus is scheduled to arrive in 20 minutes but there's still no estimate, Corvallis Bus shows nothing
    for that arrival time. If an estimate is finally published for that bus at some later point, it will be shown.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Browse Stops tab can show additional detail about the route schedules for the selected stop, such as the last arrival
    time for the day. The schedule is analyzed to find a regular pattern, like hourly or half-hourly arrivals with a 10 minute
    break in the afternoon, and can be summarized as half-hourly or hourly in the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that CTS's
    <a href="https://www.corvallisoregon.gov/cts/page/cts-service-alerts">service alerts</a> can contradict the arrival times and
    route paths indicated in the app. Check the service alerts tab periodically in the app, or
    <a href="https://www.corvallisoregon.gov/index.aspx?page=18">sign up</a> for service alerts via email.
